## Numix
This is a fork of the [Numix GTK theme](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-gtk-theme) which uses the Solarized colour scheme.

## Build It

First, you need to compile the theme using the [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) compiler.

To install Sass, install Ruby and the gem command using your distribution's package manager. Then install `sass` with the `gem` command,

`gem install sass`

You'll also need the ```glib-compile-schemas``` and  ```gdk-pixbuf-pixdata``` commands in your path to generate the gresource binary. Install them using your distribution's package manager.

|Distro|Commands|
|:----:|:----:|
|![arch][arch] &nbsp;![antergos][antergos]|`sudo pacman -S glib2 gdk-pixbuf2`|
|![opensuse][opensuse]|`sudo zipper install glib2-devel gdk-pixbuf-devel`|
|![fedora][fedora]|`sudo dnf install glib2-devel gdk-pixbuf2-devel`|
|![debian][debian] &nbsp;![ubuntu][ubuntu]|`sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev libxml2-utils`|

After installing all the dependencies, change to the cloned directory and, run the following in Terminal,

```sh
sudo make install
```
